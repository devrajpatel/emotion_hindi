# Emotion Recognition from Hindi Language Social Media Posts

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for recognizing emotions from Hindi language social media posts. We will utilize word embedding techniques to convert the text data into numeric vectors and employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models for classification.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Indic NLP Library (for Hindi text processing)

## Dataset

We will use a labeled dataset of Hindi social media posts with emotions labeled as Happy, Sad, Angry, Excited, and Neutral. The dataset will be preprocessed to remove noise and ensure compatibility with the models.

## Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, remove special characters, and tokenize the text. Stopword removal and stemming may also be applied.

2. Word Embedding: Employ popular word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec or FastText to convert the text into dense numeric vectors.

3. BiLSTM Model: Build a Bidirectional LSTM model to capture the sequential information in the text data and learn emotion representations.

4. Model Training: The dataset will be split into training and testing sets. The BiLSTM model will be trained on the training set and validated on the testing set.

5. Evaluation: We will evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results

After training and evaluation, we present the model's performance metrics and visualization of the results, showcasing the emotion recognition accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of emotion recognition from Hindi language social media posts using word embedding and BiLSTM methods. The trained model can be used for sentiment analysis and emotion detection tasks in various applications, such as social media sentiment analysis and customer feedback analysis in Hindi.
